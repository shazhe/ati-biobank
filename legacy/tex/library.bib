abstract = {Many scientific and engineering challenges---ranging from personalized medicine to customized marketing recommendations---require an understanding of treatment effect heterogeneity. In this paper, we develop a non-parametric causal forest for estimating heterogeneous treatment effects that extends Breiman's widely used random forest algorithm. Given a potential outcomes framework with unconfoundedness, we show that causal forests are pointwise consistent for the true treatment effect, and have an asymptotically Gaussian and centered sampling distribution. We also discuss a practical method for constructing asymptotic confidence intervals for the true treatment effect that are centered at the causal forest estimates. Our theoretical results rely on a generic Gaussian theory for a large family of random forest algorithms that, to our knowledge, is the first set of results that allows any type of random forest, including classification and regression forests, to be used for provably valid statistical inference. In experiments, we find causal forests to be substantially more powerful than classical methods based on nearest-neighbor matching, especially as the number of covariates increases.},

abstract = {Circular variables arise in a multitude of data-modelling contexts ranging from robots to social sciences. To correctly predict and analyse circular data, the field of circular and directional statistics has developed a range of MCMC methods for low-dimensional problems and small to medium-sized datasets. In this paper, we extend the toolbox of circular statistics to higher dimensions as a step towards bringing this field and probabilistic machine learning together. To achieve this task, we introduce a Gaussian Process analogue for circular variables and outline how to perform variational inference for this model. We demonstrate how this model naturally occurs in the contexts of regression and latent variable modelling and present experimental results where this model overperforms standard probabilistic machine learning approaches that do not account for the topological properties of circular variables.},

abstract = {The do-calculus was developed in 1995 to facilitate the identification of causal effects in non-parametric models. The completeness proofs of [Huang and Valtorta, 2006] and [Shpitser and Pearl, 2006] and the graphical criteria of [Tian and Shpitser, 2010] have laid this identification problem to rest. Recent explorations unveil the usefulness of the do-calculus in three additional areas: mediation analysis [Pearl, 2012], transportability [Pearl and Bareinboim, 2011] and metasynthesis. Meta-synthesis (freshly coined) is the task of fusing empirical results from several diverse studies, conducted on heterogeneous populations and under different conditions, so as to synthesize an estimate of a causal relation in some target environment, potentially different from those under study. The talk surveys these results with emphasis on the challenges posed by meta-synthesis. For background material, see http://bayes.cs.ucla.edu/csl{\_}papers.html},

abstract = {Humans demonstrate remarkable abilities to predict physical events in complex scenes. Two classes of models for physical scene understanding have recently been proposed: "Intuitive Physics Engines", or IPEs, which posit that people make predictions by running approximate probabilistic simulations in causal mental models similar in nature to video-game physics engines, and memory-based models, which make judgments based on analogies to stored experiences of previously encountered scenes and physical outcomes. Versions of the latter have recently been instantiated in convolutional neural network (CNN) architectures. Here we report four experiments that, to our knowledge, are the first rigorous comparisons of simulation-based and CNN-based models, where both approaches are concretely instantiated in algorithms that can run on raw image inputs and produce as outputs physical judgments such as whether a stack of blocks will fall. Both approaches can achieve super-human accuracy levels and can quantitatively predict human judgments to a similar degree, but only the simulation-based models generalize to novel situations in ways that people do, and are qualitatively consistent with systematic perceptual illusions and judgment asymmetries that people show.},

Such methods make various assumptions on the data generating process to facilitate its identification from purely observational data. Continuing this line of research; we show how to discover the complete causal structure of continuous-valued data; under the assump- tions that (a) the data generating process is linear; (b) there are no unobserved confounders; and (c) disturbance variables have non-Gaussian distributions of non-zero variances. The solution relies on the use of the statistical method known as independent component analysis; and does not require any pre-specified time-ordering of the variables.

@article{Penny2004b,
abstract = {The brain appears to adhere to two fundamental principles of functional organisation, functional integration and functional specialisation, where the integration within and among specialised areas is mediated by effective connectivity. In this paper, we review two different approaches to modelling effective connectivity from fMRI data, structural equation models (SEMs) and dynamic causal models (DCMs). In common to both approaches are model comparison frameworks in which inferences can be made about effective connectivity per se and about how that connectivity can be changed by perceptual or cognitive set. Underlying the two approaches, however, are two very different generative models. In DCM, a distinction is made between the 'neuronal level' and the 'hemodynamic level'. Experimental inputs cause changes in effective connectivity expressed at the level of neurodynamics, which in turn cause changes in the observed hemodynamics. In SEM, changes in effective connectivity lead directly to changes in the covariance structure of the observed hemodynamics. Because changes in effective connectivity in the brain occur at a neuronal level DCM is the preferred model for fMRI data. This review focuses on the underlying assumptions and limitations of each model and demonstrates their application to data from a study of attention to visual motion. ?? 2004 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {We present an algorithmic framework for learning local causal structure around target variables of interest in the form of direct causes/effects and Markov blankets applicable to very large data sets with relatively small samples. The selected feature sets can be used for causal discovery and clas-sification. The framework (Generalized Local Learning, or GLL) can be instantiated in numerous ways, giving rise to both existing state-of-the-art as well as novel algorithms. The resulting algo-rithms are sound under well-defined sufficient conditions. In a first set of experiments we evaluate several algorithms derived from this framework in terms of predictivity and feature set parsimony and compare to other local causal discovery methods and to state-of-the-art non-causal feature se-lection methods using real data. A second set of experimental evaluations compares the algorithms in terms of ability to induce local causal neighborhoods using simulated and resimulated data and examines the relation of predictivity with causal induction performance. Our experiments demonstrate, consistently with causal feature selection theory, that local causal feature selection methods (under broad assumptions encompassing appropriate family of distribu-c Constantin F. Aliferis, Alexander Statnikov, Ioannis Tsamardinos, Subramani Mani and Xenofon D. Koutsoukos. ALIFERIS, STATNIKOV, TSAMARDINOS, MANI AND KOUTSOUKOS tions, types of classifiers, and loss functions) exhibit strong feature set parsimony, high predictivity and local causal interpretability. Although non-causal feature selection methods are often used in practice to shed light on causal relationships, we find that they cannot be interpreted causally even when they achieve excellent predictivity. Therefore we conclude that only local causal techniques should be used when insight into causal structure is sought. In a companion paper we examine in depth the behavior of GLL algorithms, provide extensions, and show how local techniques can be used for scalable and accurate global causal graph learning.},

@article{Smith2015,
abstract = {The Human Connectome Project (HCP) 1 is acquiring high-quality in vivo macroscopic-level connectome imaging data from over a thousand healthy adult subjects in an effort to elucidate the neural pathways and networks that underlie brain function and behavior. An overarching aim is to reveal much about what makes us uniquely human and what makes individuals different from each other by understanding how brain networks integrate information through the complex pattern of neural connections. To date, data sets from 500 subjects have been publicly released, including imaging data measuring functional and structural brain connectivity, as well as 280 non-imaging subject measures (SMs), including demographics (age, sex, income, education level, drug use, etc.), psychometrics (IQ, language performance, etc.) and other behavioral measures such as 'rule-breaking behavior' . We sought to relate functional connectomes to behavior in a single integrated analysis. This goes further than simply investigating which SMs correlate with other SMs; we wanted to discover whether any specific patterns of brain connectivity are associated with specific sets of correlated demographics and behavior, as brain-behavior modes of population co-variation. We used resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data from 461 HCP subjects, and network modeling tools from FSL (FMRIB Software Library). A population-average brain parcellation was estimated using independent component analysis 2 , yielding 200 distinct brain regions; these constitute the nodes in our network modeling. The functional connections (edges) between these nodes were estimated using Tikhonov-regularized partial correlation, resulting in a 200 × 200 connectome for each subject. These connec-tomes were combined into a single large connectome matrix (con-taining all connectomes from all subjects; Supplementary Fig. 1). Separately, 158 behavioral and demographic non-imaging SMs from the same set of subjects were formed into a subject measure matrix. We regressed potential confounds (including brain size and head motion) out of both matrices. Redundancies among connectomes and SMs were reduced by (separately) keeping just the first 100 principal components of each matrix. A natural choice of method for investigating underlying relation-ships between two sets of variables is canonical correlation analysis (CCA) 3 , a procedure that seeks maximal correlations between com-binations of variables in both sets. Using CCA, we estimated pairs of canonical variates along which sets of SMs and patterns of brain con-nectivity co-vary in a similar way across subjects. We refer to each such pair of variates as a mode of co-variation. Strict tests were applied to avoid over-fitting and false-positive inflation. Statistical significance was determined with a permutation test that accounted for the fam-ily structure of the HCP data 4 . This analysis revealed a single highly significant CCA mode that relates functional connectomes to subject measures (r = 0.87, P {\textless} 10 −5 corrected for multiple comparisons across all modes estimated). These analyses were driven by and report only correlations; inferring and interpreting the (presumably complex and diverse) causalities remains a challenging issue for the future.},

abstract = {The analysis of brain imaging data has recently focused on the examination of the covariances of activity among neural regions during different behaviors. We present some of the theoretical and technical issues surrounding one of these covariance-based methods: structural equation modeling. In structural equation modeling, connections between brain areas are based on known neuroanatomy, and the interregional covariances of activity are used to calculate path coefficients representing the magnitude of the influence of each directional path. The logic behind the use of structural equation modeling stems from the suggestion that brain function is the result of changes in the covariances of activity among neural elements. The technical foundations for neural structural equation models are presented, emphasizing the ability to make inferential comparisons to evaluate the experimental changes in path coefficients. Simulated data sets were used to test the effects of omitted regions and omitted connections. The results suggested that structural modeling algorithms can give hints as to possible external influences and missing paths, but that the final decision as to model modifications requires the guidance of the researcher. The utility of anatomically based models to distinguish between the direct effect of one region on another, and indirect effects of darkness or patterned light on the metabolic activity in the rat visual system. The anatomical framework for the structural equation models revealed that the total impact of ascending thalamocortical influences was modified by corticocortical interactions. Extensions of structural equation modeling to human brain imaging experiments are presented. We conclude by suggesting that neural covariances may be a more accurate way to examine the dynamic functional organization of the central nervous system.},

abstract = {The do-calculus was developed in 1995 to facilitate the identification of causal effects in non-parametric models. The completeness proofs of [Huang and Valtorta, 2006] and [Shpitser and Pearl, 2006] and the graphical criteria of [Tian and Shpitser, 2010] have laid this identification problem to rest. Recent explorations unveil the usefulness of the do-calculus in three additional areas: mediation analysis [Pearl, 2012], transportability [Pearl and Bareinboim, 2011] and metasynthesis. Meta-synthesis (freshly coined) is the task of fusing empirical results from several diverse studies, conducted on heterogeneous populations and under different conditions, so as to synthesize an estimate of a causal relation in some target environment, potentially different from those under study. The talk surveys these results with emphasis on the challenges posed by meta-synthesis. For background material, see http://bayes.cs.ucla.edu/csl{\_}papers.html},

abstract = {Is it possible to prevent atrophy of key brain regions related to cognitive decline and Alzheimer's disease (AD)? One approach is to modify nongenetic risk factors, for instance by lowering elevated plasma homocysteine using B vitamins. In an initial, randomized controlled study on elderly subjects with increased dementia risk (mild cognitive impairment according to 2004 Petersen criteria), we showed that high-dose B-vitamin treatment (folic acid 0.8 mg, vitamin B6 20 mg, vitamin B12 0.5 mg) slowed shrinkage of the whole brain volume over 2 y. Here, we go further by demonstrating that B-vitamin treatment reduces, by as much as seven fold, the cerebral atrophy in those gray matter (GM) regions specifically vulnerable to the AD process, including the medial temporal lobe. In the placebo group, higher homocysteine levels at baseline are associated with faster GM atrophy, but this deleterious effect is largely prevented by B-vitamin treatment. We additionally show that the beneficial effect of B vitamins is confined to participants with high homocysteine (above the median, 11 µmol/L) and that, in these participants, a causal Bayesian network analysis indicates the following chain of events: B vitamins lower homocysteine, which directly leads to a decrease in GM atrophy, thereby slowing cognitive decline. Our results show that B-vitamin supplementation can slow the atrophy of specific brain regions that are a key component of the AD process and that are associated with cognitive decline. Further B-vitamin supplementation trials focusing on elderly subjets with high homocysteine levels are warranted to see if progression to dementia can be prevented.},

@article{Smith2011,
abstract = {There is great interest in estimating brain "networks" from FMRI data. This is often attempted by identifying a set of functional "nodes" (e.g., spatial ROIs or ICA maps) and then conducting a connectivity analysis between the nodes, based on the FMRI timeseries associated with the nodes. Analysis methods range from very simple measures that consider just two nodes at a time (e.g., correlation between two nodes' timeseries) to sophisticated approaches that consider all nodes simultaneously and estimate one global network model (e.g., Bayes net models). Many different methods are being used in the literature, but almost none has been carefully validated or compared for use on FMRI timeseries data. In this work we generate rich, realistic simulated FMRI data for a wide range of underlying networks, experimental protocols and problematic confounds in the data, in order to compare different connectivity estimation approaches. Our results show that in general correlation-based approaches can be quite successful, methods based on higher-order statistics are less sensitive, and lag-based approaches perform very poorly. More specifically: there are several methods that can give high sensitivity to network connection detection on good quality FMRI data, in particular, partial correlation, regularised inverse covariance estimation and several Bayes net methods; however, accurate estimation of connection directionality is more difficult to achieve, though Patel's ??can be reasonably successful. With respect to the various confounds added to the data, the most striking result was that the use of functionally inaccurate ROIs (when defining the network nodes and extracting their associated timeseries) is extremely damaging to network estimation; hence, results derived from inappropriate ROI definition (such as via structural atlases) should be regarded with great caution. ?? 2010 Elsevier Inc.},

@article{Ramsey2006,
abstract = {Most causal inference algorithms in the literature (e.g., Pearl (2000), Spirtes et al. (2000), Heckerman et al. (1999)) exploit an assumption usually referred to as the causal Faithfulness or Stability condition. In this paper, we highlight two components of the condition used in constraint-based algorithms, which we call "Adjacency-Faithfulness" and "Orientation-Faithfulness". We point out that assuming Adjacency-Faithfulness is true, it is in principle possible to test the validity of Orientation-Faithfulness. Based on this observation, we explore the consequence of making only the Adjacency-Faithfulness assumption. We show that the familiar PC algorithm has to be modified to be (asymptotically) correct under the weaker, Adjacency-Faithfulness assumption. Roughly the modified algorithm, called Conservative PC (CPC), checks whether Orientation-Faithfulness holds in the orientation phase, and if not, avoids drawing certain causal conclusions the PC algorithm would draw. However, if the stronger, standard causal Faithfulness condition actually obtains, the CPC algorithm is shown to output the same pattern as the PC algorithm does in the large sample limit. We also present a simulation study showing that the CPC algorithm runs almost as fast as the PC algorithm, and outputs significantly fewer false causal arrowheads than the PC algorithm does on realistic sample sizes. We end our paper by discussing how score-based algorithms such as GES perform when the Adjacency-Faithfulness but not the standard causal Faithfulness condition holds, and how to extend our work to the FCI algorithm, which allows for the possibility of latent variables.},

abstract = {Recent work regarding the analysis of brain imaging data has focused on examining functional and effective connectivity of the brain. We develop a novel descriptive and inferential method to analyze the connectivity of the human brain using functional MRI (fMRI). We assess the relationship between pairs of distinct brain regions by comparing expected joint and marginal probabilities of elevated activity of voxel pairs through a Bayesian paradigm, which allows for the incorporation of previously known anatomical and functional information. We define the relationship between two distinct brain regions by measures of functional connectivity and ascendancy. After assessing the relationship between all pairs of brain voxels, we are able to construct hierarchical functional networks from any given brain region and assess significant functional connectivity and ascendancy in these networks. We illustrate the use of our connectivity analysis using data from an fMRI study of social cooperation among women who played an iterated "Prisoner's Dilemma" game. Our analysis reveals a functional network that includes the amygdala, anterior insula cortex, and anterior cingulate cortex, and another network that includes the ventral striatum, orbitofrontal cortex, and anterior insula. Our method can be used to develop causal brain networks for use with structural equation modeling and dynamic causal models.},

We illustrate the performance of space by extensive simulation studies. It is shown that space performs well in both non-zero partial correlation selection and the identification of hub variables, and also outperforms two existing methods. We then apply space to a microarray breast cancer data set and identify a set of hub genes which may provide important insights on genetic regulatory networks.

abstract = {In this paper we present an approach to the identification of nonlinear input-state-output systems. By using a bilinear approximation to the dynamics of interactions among states, the parameters of the implicit causal model reduce to three sets. These comprise (1) parameters that mediate the influence of extrinsic inputs on the states, (2) parameters that mediate intrinsic coupling among the states, and (3) [bilinear] parameters that allow the inputs to modulate that coupling. Identification proceeds in a Bayesian framework given known, deterministic inputs and the observed responses of the system. We developed this approach for the analysis of effective connectivity using experimentally designed inputs and fMRI responses. In this context, the coupling parameters correspond to effective connectivity and the bilinear parameters reflect the changes in connectivity induced by inputs. The ensuing framework allows one to characterise fMRI experiments, conceptually, as an experimental manipulation of integration among brain regions (by contextual or trial-free inputs, like time or attentional set) that is revealed using evoked responses (to perturbations or trial-bound inputs, like stimuli). As with previous analyses of effective connectivity, the focus is on experimentally induced changes in coupling (cf., psychophysiologic interactions). However, unlike previous approaches in neuroimaging, the causal model ascribes responses to designed deterministic inputs, as opposed to treating inputs as unknown and stochastic. ?? 2003 Elsevier Science (USA).

We propose a technique called "Gaussianiza- tion" for high dimensional density estimation, which alleviates the curse of dimensionality by exploiting the independence structures in the data. Gaussianization is motivated from recent developments in the statistics literature: projection pursuit, independent component analysis and Gaus- sian mixture models with semi-tied covariances. We propose an iter- ative Gaussianization procedure which converges weakly: at each it- eration, the data is first transformed to the least dependent coordinates and then each coordinate is marginally Gaussianized by univariate tech- niques. Gaussianization offers density estimation sharper than traditional kernel methods and radial basis function methods. Gaussianization can be viewed as efficient solution of nonlinear independent component anal- ysis and high dimensional projection pursuit.},

abstract = {This article describes the use of Bayes factors for comparing dynamic causal models (DCMs). DCMs are used to make inferences about effective connectivity from functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data. These inferences, however, are contingent upon assumptions about model structure, that is, the connectivity pattern between the regions included in the model. Given the current lack of detailed knowledge on anatomical connectivity in the human brain, there are often considerable degrees of freedom when defining the connectional structure of DCMs. In addition, many plausible scientific hypotheses may exist about which connections are changed by experimental manipulation, and a formal procedure for directly comparing these competing hypotheses is highly desirable. In this article, we show how Bayes factors can be used to guide choices about model structure, both concerning the intrinsic connectivity pattern and the contextual modulation of individual connections. The combined use of Bayes factors and DCM thus allows one to evaluate competing scientific theories about the architecture of large-scale neural networks and the neuronal interactions that mediate perception and cognition. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier Inc.

The parallelised algorithms help speed up the procedure of experimenting big datasets and reduce the memory used when running the algorithms. The package is not only suitable for super-computers or clusters, but also convenient for researchers using personal computers with multi core CPUs. Our experiment results on real world datasets show that using the parallelised algorithms it is now practical to explore causal relationships in high dimensional datasets with thousands of variables in a single multicore computer.
