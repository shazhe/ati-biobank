# Week 4 Todo/Summary
------
## TODO

1. Decide which variables to keep (check with Gwen), (removed = (r))
  * Nominal variables in general
    * 20098: Weird encodings (r)
  * Messed up variables 
    * Binary
        * 22620: binary - messed up as categorical. (r)
    * Continuous
        * 3062: continuous - data storage like categorical. (r)
        * 3063: continuous - data storage like categorical. (r)
        * 22605: continuous - data storage like categorical. (r)
    * Discrete
    * 20230: discrete - messed up encodings. (r)
    * 102: discrete - data storage like categorical.(r)
    * 399: discrete - data storage like categorical. (r)
    * 3064: discrete - data storage like categorical. (r)
    * 4079: discrete - data storage like categorical. (r)
    * 4080: discrete - data storage like categorical. (r)
    * 20132: discrete - data storage like categorical. (r)
    * 20133: discrete - data storage like categorical. (r)
    * 20155: discrete - data storage like categorical. (r)
    * 20149: discrete - data storage like categorical. (r)

2. Presentation
   * Make some graphics
     * Add stats about the Biobank wrong encodings
   * Write some JS scripts to make our work look good

3. Data imputation
   * The main methods are already done, actually.

4. Causal Inference
    * Methodology: assumptions and procedures; how to deal with confoundings? etc
    * Modelling: how to model or transform descrete variables and categorical variables?
    * implementation: software packages and computational bottleneck for large network data
